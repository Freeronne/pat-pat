          "One tree is presented to the kids every workshop using paintatreeplantatree material, including for example the upside down tree, the umbrella tree and the Japanese cherry tree. Through this material, the kids learn interesting facts about the tree: where it grows, its fruit, its animal friends, its symbolism, its height and width, and most importantly, how it helps us human beings and its animal friends – the oxygen it produces, the shade and shelter it provides, the fruit it bears, the water it stores, the peace and quiet it provides, the medicine and music it makes and so much more.",
          "The kids are then asked to paint the tree in their fashion. Using, acrylic, gouache, aquarelle, crayons, pencils, felt pens, their fingers, hands or feet and toes if they prefer - whatever they like - as long as paintatreeplantatree is provided with a photo of their art to exhibit on the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/paintatreeplantatree/\" target=\"_blank\">paintatreeplantatree Instagram</a> gallery!",
          "And finally, <span class=\"bold\">during one workshop, somewhere close to the kids, with the authorization of local authorities if necessary, the cherry on the cake, we plant a tree</span>. And day by day watch it grow."
